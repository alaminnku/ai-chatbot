Reception and public image
In the 1990s, Depp was seen as a new type of male film star that rejected the norms of that role.[216][217] After becoming a teen idol in 21 Jump Street,[218] he publicly protested against the image, and with his subsequent film and public relations choices began to cultivate a new public persona.[216][217] The Sydney Morning Herald characterized Depp in the 1990s as the "bad boy of Hollywood";[219] Depp's chain smoking,[219] recreational drug use and drinking habits were generally documented during this time.[220] According to The Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman in 2020:

"Along with Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, he was part of a holy trinity of grunge heart-throbs. They were the opposite of the Beverly Hills, 90210 boys, or Brad Pitt and DiCaprio, because they seemed embarrassed by their looks, even resentful of them. ...This uninterest in their own prettiness made them seem edgy, even while their prettiness softened that edge. They signified not just a different kind of celebrity, but a different kind of masculinity: desirable but gentle, manly but girlish. Depp in particular was the cool pinup it was safe to like, and the safe pinup it was cool to like. We fans understood that there was more to Depp, Phoenix and Reeves than handsomeness. They were artistic—they had bands!—and they thought really big thoughts, which they would ramble on about confusingly in interviews. If we dated them, we understood that our role would be to understand their souls."[216]

Similarly, film scholar Anna Everett has described Depp's 1990s films and public persona as "anti-macho" and "gender-bending", going against the conventions of a Hollywood leading man.[217] After 21 Jump Street, Depp chose to work in independent films, often taking on quirky roles that sometimes even completely obscured his looks, such as Edward Scissorhands.[216][217] Critics often described Depp's characters as "iconic loners" or "gentle outsiders".[217] According to Depp, his onetime agent, Tracey Jacobs of United Talent Agency (UTA), had to take "a lot of heat over the years" for his role choices; Depp characterized higher-ups at UTA as thinking, "Jesus Christ! When does he do a movie where he kisses the girl? When does he get to pull a gun out and shoot somebody? When does he get to be a [fucking] man for a change? When is he finally going to do a blockbuster?"[221] Depp also cultivated the image of a bad boy. According to Everett, his "rule-breaking" roles matched with the "much publicized rebelliousness, unconventionality, and volatility ascribed to Depp's own personal life throughout the decade. From reports of his repeated confrontations with the police, trashing of a hotel room, chain smoking, drinking, and drug use, to his multiple engagements to such glamorous women as supermodel Kate Moss and Hollywood starlet Winona Ryder and others, we clearly see a perfect fit between his non-conformist star image and his repertoire of outsider characters".[217]

After a decade of appearing mainly in independent films with varying commercial success, Depp became one of the biggest box-office draws in the 2000s with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Walt Disney Studios' Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.[222] The five films in the series have earned US$4.5 billion as of 2021. In addition to the Pirates franchise, Depp also made further four films with Tim Burton that were major successes, with one, Alice in Wonderland (2010), becoming the biggest commercial hit of Depp's career and one of the highest-grossing films in history (as of 2021).[223]

According to film scholar Murray Pomerance, Depp's collaboration with Disney "can be seen to purport and herald a new era for Johnny Depp, one in which he is, finally, as though long-promised and long-expected, the proud proprietor of a much-accepted career; not only a star but a middle-class hero".[222] In 2003, the same year as the first film in the Pirates series was released, Depp was named "World's Sexiest Man" by People; he would receive the title again in 2009.[222] During the decade and into the 2010s, Depp was one of the biggest and most popular film stars in the world[1][2] and was named by public vote as "Favorite Male Movie Star" at the People's Choice Awards every year for 2005 through 2012. In 2012, Depp became the highest-paid actor in the American film industry, earning as high as $75 million per film,[3] and as of 2020, is the tenth highest-grossing actor worldwide, with his films having grossed over US$3.7 billion at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide.[224] Although a mainstream favorite with the audiences, critics' views on Depp changed in the 2000s, becoming more negative as he was seen to conform more to the Hollywood ideal.[222] Regardless, Depp continued to eschew more traditional leading-man roles until towards the end of the 2000s, when he starred as John Dillinger in Public Enemies (2009).[222]

In the 2010s, Depp's films were less successful, with many big-budget studio films such as Dark Shadows (2012), The Lone Ranger (2013), and Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016) which underperformed at the box office.[113][116][117] Depp also received negative publicity due to allegations of domestic violence, substance abuse, poor on-set behavior and the loss of his US$650 million fortune.[225][226][227][228][216] After losing a highly publicized libel trial against the publishers of The Sun, Depp was asked to resign from Warner Bros.' Fantastic Beasts franchise.[155] Many publications alleged that Depp would struggle to find further work in major studio productions in the future.[159][216][229]

Personal life
Relationships
Depp and makeup artist Lori Anne Allison were married from 1983 until 1985.[230] In the late 1980s, he was engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn.[216] In 1990, he proposed to his Edward Scissorhands co-star Winona Ryder, who he began dating the year prior when she was 17 and he was 26.[231][232] They ended their relationship in 1993;[231] Depp later had the "Winona Forever" tattoo on his right arm changed to "Wino Forever".[216] Between 1994 and 1998, he was in a relationship with English model Kate Moss.[233] Following his breakup from Moss, Depp began a relationship with French actress and singer Vanessa Paradis, whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate in France in 1998. They have two children, daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born 1999) and a son, Jack (born 2002).[234] Depp stated that having children has given him a "real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything ...You cannot plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny. All the math finally worked". Depp and Paradis announced that they had separated in June 2012.[235]

Amber Heard

Following the end of his relationship with Vanessa Paradis, Depp began dating actress Amber Heard, with whom he had co-starred in The Rum Diary (2011).[236] Depp and Heard were married in a civil ceremony in February 2015.[237][238][239] Heard filed for divorce in May 2016 and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, alleging in her court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.[240][241][242][228] Depp denied these claims and alleged that she was "attempting to secure a premature financial resolution".[243][240][244] A settlement was reached in August 2016,[245] and the divorce was finalized in January 2017.[246] Heard dismissed the restraining order, and they issued a joint statement saying that their "relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm".[245] Depp paid Heard a divorce settlement of US$7 million, which she pledged to donate[247] to the ACLU[248] and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA).[249][250]

Legal issues
Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd
Main article: Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd
In 2018,[251] Depp brought a libel lawsuit in the UK against News Group Newspapers (NGN), publishers of The Sun, over an April 2018 article titled "GONE POTTY How Can J K Rowling be "genuinely happy" casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?".[252][253][254] The case had a highly publicized trial in July 2020, with both Depp and Heard testifying for several days.[255] In November 2020, the High Court of Justice ruled that 12 of the 14 incidents of violence claimed by Heard were "substantially true".[253][254] The court rejected Depp's claim of a hoax[256] and accepted that the allegations Heard had made against Depp had damaged her career and activism.[253][254] Following the verdict, Depp resigned from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, after being asked to do so by its production company, Warner Bros.[157]

Depp appealed the verdict, with his lawyers accusing Heard of not following through on the charity pledge, and that the pledge had significantly influenced the judge's view of Heard.[257] In response, Heard's legal team stated that she had not donated the full amount yet due to the lawsuits against her by Depp.[258] Depp's appeal to overturn the verdict was rejected by the Court of Appeal in March 2021.[259] The Court of Appeal did not find the argument that the charity pledge influenced the outcome convincing, as the judge in the trial had reached their verdict by evaluating the evidence related to the 14 alleged incidents of violence; the issue of the donation was not part of it, but a comment made after the verdict had already been reached.[260]

Depp v. Heard
Main article: Depp v. Heard
In February 2019, Depp sued Heard for defamation over a December 2018 op-ed for The Washington Post.[261][262][263] The lawsuit ultimately resulting in Depp alleging that the op-ed contained three defamatory statements: first, its headline, "Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change"; second, Heard's writing: "Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out"; and third, Heard's writing: "I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse."[4][264] Depp alleged that he had been the one who was abused by Heard, that her allegations constituted a hoax against him, and that as a consequence, Disney had declined to cast him in future projects.[261][263]

Heard countersued Depp in August 2020, alleging that he had coordinated "a harassment campaign via Twitter and [by] orchestrating online petitions in an effort to get her fired from Aquaman and L'Oreal".[265][266] Ultimately, Heard's counter-suit went to trial over three allegations that Depp that defamed her through statements made by his then-lawyer, Adam Waldman, published in the Daily Mail in April 2020: first, Waldman stated that "Heard and her friends in the media used fake sexual violence allegations as both sword and shield", publicizing a "sexual violence hoax" against Depp; second, Waldman stated that in one incident at a penthouse, "Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up, got their stories straight under the direction of a lawyer and publicist, and then placed a second call to 911" as a "hoax" against Depp; third, Waldman stated that there had been an "abuse hoax" by Heard against Depp.[4][5]

In October 2020, the judge in the case dismissed Depp's lawyer Adam Waldman after he leaked confidential information covered by a protective order to the media.[159][267] Following the verdict in Depp's lawsuit against The Sun the next month, Heard's lawyers filed to have the defamation suit dismissed, but judge Penny Azcarate ruled against it because Heard had not been a defendant in the UK case.[268] In August 2021, a New York judge ruled that the ACLU must disclose documents related to Heard's charity pledge to the organization.[269][270]

The Depp-Heard trial took place in Fairfax County, Virginia from April 11, 2022, to June 1, 2022.[271] In their verdict, the jury found that all three statements from Heard's op-ed were false, defamed Depp, and made with actual malice, so the jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages from Heard.[4][5] The punitive damages were reduced to $350,000 due to a limit imposed by Virginia state law.[272] For Heard's counter-suit, the jury found that Waldman's first and third statements to the Daily Mail were not defamatory, while finding that Waldman's second statement to the Daily Mail was false, defamatory and made with actual malice.[5] As a result, Heard was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and zero in punitive damages from Depp.[4]

Depp reacted to the result of the trial by declaring that the "jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled."[273] Depp also stated that he was "overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the colossal support and kindness from around the world." He continued: "I hope that my quest to have the truth be told will have helped others, men or women, who have found themselves in my situation, and that those supporting them never give up."[274] Depp also highlighted "the noble work of the Judge, the jurors, the court staff and the Sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to get to this point", and praised his "diligent and unwavering legal team" for "an extraordinary job".[275]

After Heard appealed the verdict, Heard in December 2022 settled the case against Depp, while maintaining that the settlement was "not an act of concession"; meanwhile Depp's lawyers stated that the "jury's unanimous decision and the resulting judgement in Mr. Depp's favor against Ms. Heard remain fully in place", and that the settlement would result in $1 million being paid to Depp, which "Depp is pledging and will donate to charities".[276][277]

Other legal issues
Depp was arrested in Vancouver in 1989 for assaulting a security guard after the police were called to end a loud party at his hotel room.[278] He was also arrested in New York City in 1994 after causing significant damage to his room at The Mark Hotel, where he was staying with Kate Moss, his girlfriend. The charges were dropped against him after he agreed to pay US$9,767 in damages.[279]

Depp was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazi, when the photographers tried to take his picture. He allegedly threatened them with a wooden plank when they approached him outside Mirabelle restaurant in central London early on Sunday morning.[280]

In 2012, UC Irvine medical professor Robin Eckert sued Depp and three security firms, Premier Group International, Damian Executive Production Inc. and Staff Pro Inc.[281], claiming to have been roughed up by his bodyguards at a concert in Los Angeles in 2011. During the incident, she was allegedly hand-cuffed and dragged 40 feet across the floor, resulting in injuries including a dislocated elbow. Depp's attorneys contended that Eckert provoked the alleged assault and therefore "consented to any assault and battery".[282] Ekert's court papers stated that Depp, despite being his security guards' direct manager, did nothing to stop the attack.[283] Before the case went to trial, Depp settled with Eckert for an undisclosed sum, according to TMZ.[284]

In April 2015, Depp's then-wife Amber Heard breached Australia's biosecurity laws when she failed to declare their two dogs to the customs when they flew to Queensland, where he was working on a film.[285][286] Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation.[287] She was placed on a $1,000 one-month good behavior bond for producing a false document;[288] Heard and Depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the biosecurity laws.[288] The Guardian called the case the "highest profile criminal quarantine case" in Australian history.[288]

In March 2016, Depp cut ties with his management company, The Management Group (TMG), and sued them in January 2017 for allegedly improperly managing his money and leaving him over $40 million in debt.[289][290] TMG stated that Depp was responsible for his own fiscal mismanagement and countersued him for unpaid fees.[289][291] In a related suit, Depp also sued his lawyers, Bloom Hergott, in January 2017.[292] Both lawsuits were settled, the former in 2018 and the latter in 2019.[292][293][289]

In 2018, two of Depp's former bodyguards sued him for unpaid fees and unsafe working conditions.[294] The suit was settled in 2019.[295]

Also in 2018, Depp was sued for allegedly hitting and verbally insulting a crew member while under the influence of alcohol on the set of City of Lies.[296] A lawyer for Depp told the media that "Depp never touched the [crew member], as over a dozen witnesses present will attest"; meanwhile Depp's legal team entered a court filing that did not admit that Depp hit the crew member, but stated that the crew member "provoked" the incident with "unlawful and wrongful conduct", causing Depp and film director Brad Furman to fear for their safety.[297] A film script supervisor submitted a court declaration that Depp did not hit the crew member, and only scolded him.[298] Before the lawsuit went to trial, a tentative settlement regarding the dismissal of the lawsuit was reached between Depp and the crew member in July 2022.[298]
